  <h3>📙 About SCP: HERETIC</h3>
  <p><b>SCP: Heretic</b> is the final installment of SCP short-horror trilogy, building off the work of previous films, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVx2jyDPinw">SCP: Dollhouse</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOxarwd3eTs">SCP: Overlord</a>.</p>
  <h3>📙 The Story</h3>
  <p>The Foundation's target is a cell within a group of interest known as <a href="https://youtu.be/Ty1h3K6jGdE">Are We Cool Yet</a>, a worldwide collective of artists that create and publicly display works of anomalous art. The goals of the group vary from cell to cell, with some being <b>highly ideological</b>, and others simply a <b>force for chaos</b>. As such, the effects of their displays range from harmless to lethally dangerous depending on the artist involved.
  The cell of interest has recently turned inward, developing <b>occult characteristics</b> and calling themselves <b>'The Society of the Shepherd'</b>. The Foundation believes this to be the result of a recent acquisition of an ancient object of <b>cosmic power</b>, which has driven the cell to create artworks which will allow them to <b>cross over into a higher dimension</b>.</p>
